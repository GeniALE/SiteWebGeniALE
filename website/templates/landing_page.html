    <div class="header__content__paragraph">Out of the 12oz bottle, the beer pours a bright, rich amber colored brew, tainted by a touch of haze and topped with an appealing two-finger, white, creamy foam head. Fresh, powdery grist, some must, and hints of fruity esters in the nose. Near medium in body, relatively smooth on the palate, but a scrubbing carbonation breaks things up. Crisp, for a moment. Raw leafy hop tannic feel on the palate segues to a thin, watery, citric-like bitterness. Mineral flavors come to play. Malt flavors seem a bit masked at first, but there&#39;s a malt presence that provides some backing for everything else, with some apple-y fruitiness beneath. That said, as the beer warms a round and sweet caramel and toasty malty note emerges, along with some earthy and woody suggestions, but alas it&#39;s towards the end of the beer. Finishes dry with a mineral linger and sweet edges.</div>
