      <div class="paragraph">Out of the 12oz bottle, the beer pours a bright, rich
        amber colored
        brew, tainted by a touch of haze and topped with an appealing two-finger, white, creamy foam head.
        Fresh, powdery grist, some must, and hints of fruity esters in the nose. Near medium in body,
        relatively
        smooth on the palate, but a scrubbing carbonation breaks things up. Crisp, for a moment. Raw leafy
        hop
        tannic feel on the palate segues to a thin, watery, citric-like bitterness. Mineral flavors come to
        play. Malt flavors seem a bit masked at first, but there&#39;s a malt presence that provides some
        backing for everything else, with some apple-y fruitiness beneath. That said, as the beer warms a
        round
        and sweet caramel and toasty malty note emerges, along with some earthy and woody suggestions, but
        alas
        it&#39;s towards the end of the beer. Finishes dry with a mineral linger and sweet edges.
